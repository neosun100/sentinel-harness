Scenario (M5) — CVE-triage-AGAINST-ASSET, end to end over the mock world
========================================================================
Layer 3 (cyber-skills) · the "does a CVE actually threaten *this* environment?"
proof for the M5 mock data layer.

.. warning::
   **This runs entirely on CLEARLY-LABELED MOCK DATA for POC / testing only.**
   Every host id, IP, and domain is fictional (RFC 5737 documentation IPs,
   ``example.test`` domains, generic host ids). The CVE metadata comes from
   the OFFLINE stub fixtures in ``tools/{nvd_lookup,epss_kev}`` (public,
   non-sensitive CVEs). It is *not* a real NVD/EPSS/KEV feed and *not* a real
   asset inventory. See ``mockdata/README.md`` and each tool's README.

WHY this scenario exists
------------------------
A bare CVE record (CVSS 10.0, in KEV, EPSS 0.97) tells you a vuln is *dangerous
in general*. It does NOT tell a security-ops team whether the vuln threatens
*their* environment. The judgement that matters is **CVE ⋈ asset surface**:
which of *my* hosts actually expose the vulnerable service? That intersection is
the blast radius, and it is what turns "scary CVE on the internet" into "web-01
is exposed — page someone". This scenario proves that join runs end to end on
the mock world, offline and deterministic, BEFORE any real vuln feed or CMDB is
wired.

The triage walk (the "Log4Shell-against-my-fleet story")
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Take a CVE id (default ``CVE-2021-44228``, Log4Shell — present in the
   ``nvd_lookup`` offline stub). ``nvd_lookup`` -> severity / CVSS.
2. ``epss_kev`` -> exploit probability (EPSS) + CISA KEV flag (exploited in
   the wild?).
3. ``asset_lookup`` across the mock world (``query="*"``) -> which hosts expose
   a service carrying that CVE. ``web-01`` exposes the Log4Shell-vulnerable
   https service => that is the blast radius + the reachable (pivot) hosts.
4. :func:`triage` deterministically assembles a ``CVETriage`` verdict:
   ``{cve_id, severity, cvss, exploited_in_wild, affected_hosts, blast_radius,
   recommended_action}`` — no LLM, no clock, no randomness.
5. HITL: the remediation recommendation passes a ``request_human_review``-style
   gate. The offline POC records that analyst sign-off is REQUIRED before any
   remediation action — security decisions are not made by the AI alone.

What is real vs. stubbed
------------------------
- The DEFAULT run is PURE (no AWS, no network, no LLM): it exercises the three
  deterministic tools directly (loaded by unique importlib path, mirroring how
  the harness tests load them) and the deterministic :func:`triage` core. It
  records a scrubbed verdict to ``evidence/cve_asset_triage_result.json``.
- ``--live`` prints a pointer to the real CVE-triage harness where an agent
  would drive the same walk with a HITL gate. It stands up NO AWS — that wiring
  is deployment work outside this POC.

Egress & secrets posture
------------------------
- Egress is CONTROLLED. The default path has zero network I/O — it reads the
  offline tool stubs + the embedded mock world only. No tool's ``*_LIVE`` opt-in
  is set here.
- No secrets, no hardcoded account ids/ARNs. The evidence writer scrubs any
  12-digit account id out of ARNs before writing, mirroring the other scenarios.

# This is a DETERMINISTIC assembly — no LLM, no randomness, no clock. It encodes
# the analyst's judgement as an explicit, testable policy over three inputs:
#   - nvd_cve      : the CVE record (severity + CVSS) from nvd_lookup.
#   - epss_kev_rec : the EPSS/KEV enrichment for the CVE from epss_kev.
#   - asset_surface: the WHOLE known asset surface from asset_lookup("*").
#
# The headline output is ``affected_hosts``: the hosts whose exposed services
# carry THIS cve_id. That intersection is the blast radius. A CVE that matches
# no host yields an EMPTY affected_hosts list (never a crash) and a benign
# recommendation — a scary CVE that touches nothing here is not an incident.
