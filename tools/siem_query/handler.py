"""siem_query — read-only SIEM alert/event query tool over the mock world.

.. warning::
   **This serves CLEARLY-LABELED MOCK DATA for POC / testing only.** It is
   *not* a real SIEM and returns *no* real threat intelligence. Every event it
   returns is fictional data from ``mockdata.load_world()`` (RFC 5737
   documentation IPs, ``example.test`` / ``example.com`` domains, generic host
   ids). See ``README.md`` and ``mockdata/README.md``.

SecOps purpose
--------------
Alert triage starts at the SIEM: an analyst (or an agent) pulls the events for
a host, a technique, or a severity band, then pivots to enrichment, asset
lookup, and ticketing. This tool is that first hop — a **read-only** query
surface over the fictional SecOps world's alert stream. It never writes; it
only filters the deterministic event set and returns a normalized view.

Because every data-plane tool (``siem_query``, ``asset_lookup``,
``enrich_ioc``, ``create_ticket``) reads the SAME ``mockdata`` world, the host
an alert names here is the same host ``asset_lookup`` knows and the IP it
carries is the same indicator ``enrich_ioc`` scores. The headline cross-link:
``alert-1001`` (Log4Shell / ``T1190``) on ``web-01`` from the C2 IP
``203.0.113.66`` — findable here by host ``web-01`` AND by technique ``T1190``.

Input contract
--------------
Exactly one selector per call (a query shape):
    {"host": "web-01"}       # all events whose host == web-01
    {"technique": "T1190"}   # all events with that ATT&CK technique id
    {"severity": "high"}     # all events at that severity band
    {"alert_id": "alert-1001"}  # a single event by id
    {"since": "2026-06-30T00:00:00Z"}  # events at/after an ISO-8601 instant
    {"query": "*"}           # the whole alert stream

An empty event, an unknown/typo'd selector key, a non-string selector value, or
more than one selector at once is a ``validation_error`` — never a silent empty
result. An unknown *value* for a valid selector (e.g. an unknown host) is NOT
an error: it returns an empty ``events`` list, so "no matches" is
distinguishable from "malformed query".

Output contract (on success)
----------------------------
{
    "ok": True,
    "source": "stub",             # "live" only if a future backend is wired
    "count": 1,
    "events": [                    # normalized, deterministic, sorted by ts
        {
            "alert_id": "alert-1001",
            "ts": "2026-06-28T14:03:11Z",
            "severity": "critical",
            "rule_name": "Log4Shell JNDI Exploit Attempt",
            "host": "web-01",
            "src_ip": "203.0.113.66",
            "dst_ip": "192.0.2.10",
            "technique": "T1190",
            "summary": "Inbound HTTP request ...",
            "false_positive": False,
        },
        ...
    ],
}

Read-only posture
-----------------
This tool performs NO writes to the mock world (or anywhere). ``load_world()``
hands back a fresh deep copy each call, so filtering here can never mutate the
shared source. There is no clock and no randomness: the same query returns the
same events every time.

Egress & secrets posture
------------------------
- Egress is CONTROLLED. The default (offline) path has zero network I/O — it
  reads the embedded mock world only. A live SIEM backend call happens only
  when ``SIEM_QUERY_LIVE=1`` (a documented future opt-in) AND the runtime
  network policy permits egress.
- Secrets are CONTROLLED. Any future backend endpoint/token is read only from
  the environment (``SIEM_QUERY_URL`` / ``SIEM_QUERY_TOKEN``) — never
  hardcoded, logged, or echoed back in responses.
- Execution role / region are referenced via the standard harness environment
  variables ``SENTINEL_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN`` / ``SENTINEL_REGION`` /
  ``AWS_PROFILE`` (never hardcoded account IDs or ARNs).
