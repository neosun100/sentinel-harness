## Why

A security team usually already has models, internal MCP servers, and a pile of skills — what's missing is a **framework to circulate them** so that "what one analyst has, everyone has." `sentinel-harness` is a reference implementation of that framework on the [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore **Harness**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/harness.html). You declare an agent as configuration and AWS runs the whole agent loop — so swapping a model, adding a tool, or replacing a skill is **a config change, not a rebuild**.

Everything here is **generic SecOps content** built and tested against a **non-production** account — no proprietary data, no real vulnerable assets, no real malware. It reverse-engineers a common three-layer SecOps agent architecture into AgentCore primitives, borrowing verified patterns from four AWS samples.

> **What's real vs. aspirational — read this first.** Layer 1 ships **live-validated scenarios** (including a real Gateway create→READY→delete on the GA API) and a library-grade core. Layer 2 Play Mode is live-validated, and BAS detection-replay is real (a deterministic Sigma matcher finds detection blind spots offline); sample detonation stays an import-safe SIMULATED skeleton (no real malware/VM/network). Layer 3 ships a built+tested tool/skill registry, sandbox hooks, and Agent Factory; a dual-track IaC foundation (CDK + a `terraform validate`-clean Terraform mirror) where the Guardrail, Cognito JWT identity, and CloudWatch/Budgets observability stacks are **live-deployed and validated on a real dev account** (a Guardrail really masked a fake AWS key; the private-VPC PrivateLink endpoints stay cost-gated off); plus an import-safe A2A specialist skeleton (container deps/Docker not built). The [status matrix](#-status-validated--designed--missing) is precise about what's proven, built, designed, or skeleton — 🟡 rows are honest about their limits. This honesty is deliberate — see the self-audit in [`docs/FIDELITY-REPORT.md`](docs/FIDELITY-REPORT.md).

## 🏛 Architecture

<div align="center"><img src="assets/architecture.png" width="960" alt="sentinel-harness architecture"/></div>

Callers authenticate via OAuth/JWT (humans) or SigV4 (services); third-party secrets sit in the AgentCore Identity token vault (the agent never sees raw credentials). A **two-plane API** (control + streaming data) drives a **managed harness** running in a per-session Firecracker microVM — the agent loop, config fields, primitives (Memory / Gateway / Browser / Code Interpreter), an `inline_function` human-in-the-loop gate, egress control, and the multi-harness + supervisor pattern. On the right, the three SecOps layers. Full write-up: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md); layer→primitive mapping and borrowed patterns: [`docs/BLUEPRINT.md`](docs/BLUEPRINT.md).

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neosun100/sentinel-harness && cd sentinel-harness
pip install -e .          # Python 3.10+ ; installs the `sentinel` CLI

# offline tests need no AWS
SENTINEL_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/test pytest tests/ -q   # 740 passing

# configure for live runs (12-factor — nothing hardcoded)
export AWS_PROFILE=<your-non-prod-profile>          # never production
export SENTINEL_REGION=us-east-1
export SENTINEL_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN="arn:aws:iam::<acct>:role/<your-harness-role>"

# run a live-validated scenario (creates harnesses, invokes, writes evidence/)
python scenarios/scenario_cve_triage.py
python scenarios/scenario_multi_harness.py
sentinel cleanup sentinel_        # tear down every harness this repo created
```

Execution-role policy (least-privilege, and **why** it omits `InvokeAgentRuntimeCommand`): [`docs/SETUP.md`](docs/SETUP.md).

## 🔬 Scenarios & evidence

Each scenario is runnable end-to-end and writes a result JSON to [`evidence/`](evidence/) (account IDs scrubbed). Captured live-run outcomes:

| Scenario | What it proves | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **CVE triage** | one harness = deterministic compute (code interpreter) + a mandatory HITL pause + managed memory, zero orchestration code | HITL gate fired; CVSS math ran in-sandbox |
| **Multi-harness parallel** | "a harness is single-agent" → parallelism via multiple harnesses + a supervisor | **≈2.6×** wall-clock speedup vs serial |
| **Detection-gen** | generation ≠ evaluation: an **independent** reviewer harness + publish control | reviewer reached `revise` with concrete FP/logic objections; flawed rule **withheld from publish**; no stray `shell` (allowedTools-scoped) |
| **HITL resume** | full pause→approve→resume via the two-message `toolUse`+`toolResult` contract | `closed_hitl_loop: true` — analyst approval flows back, agent finishes |
| **Play Mode (L2)** | adversary emulation, every offensive step human-gated + checkpoint/resume | every step gated; reject halts; simulated no-ops (nothing real touched) |

## 🧭 Design principles

- **Multi-agent = multiple harnesses + a supervisor.** One harness is single-agent + multi-tool; parallelism and role-decomposition come from running many and synthesizing.
- **Human-in-the-loop kills hallucination.** High-stakes actions pass through an `inline_function` gate; an independent reviewer harness attacks generated artifacts (no self-approval bias).
- **Egress is controlled.** Prefer a `web_search`-style tool (text only) over raw download; there is no raw-download tool.
- **Auth done right.** An IAM *execution role* scopes internal AWS access (least privilege — not per-person mapping). Humans use OAuth/JWT; secrets live in the token vault. `allowedTools` scopes the LLM's tool choice but **cannot** gate `InvokeAgentRuntimeCommand` — the only control there is withholding the IAM action.
- **No lock-in.** When config isn't enough, `agentcore export harness` emits editable Strands code on the same compute / observability / identity.

## 🧩 Extending

- **New scenario** → add `scenarios/scenario_<name>.py` using `sentinel_harness.core` (see existing three for the pattern); write evidence to `evidence/`; leave teardown to `sentinel cleanup`.
- **New tool** → drop a handler under `tools/<name>/` (keep deterministic tools LLM-free, like `sigma_yara_lint`) and wire it into an AgentCore Gateway as an MCP target.
- **New skill** → add `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (AgentSkills.io format: YAML frontmatter + body); attach via `create_harness(skills=[...])`.
- **New harness** → follow `harnesses/<name>/` (a `system_prompt.md` + an illustrative `harness.yaml`); until the YAML loader lands (roadmap), construct via `core.create_harness(...)` in a scenario.

Borrowed patterns (see [`docs/BLUEPRINT.md`](docs/BLUEPRINT.md)): supervisor→specialist delegation (pluggable-agentic-ai-framework), long-running session + self-restart (long-running-app-harness), zero-orchestration tool selection (serverless-image-editing-harness), Agent Factory provisioning (agentic-chatbot-accelerator).

## 🗺 Roadmap

- [x] **YAML→harness loader** so `harnesses/*.yaml` are live (`sentinel create <harness.yaml>`; env interpolation, `system_prompt.md` resolution, gateway/allowedTools mapping). — `loader.py`
- [x] **Close the HITL loop** — `invoke_with_tool_result()` two-message resume + a full live pause→approve→resume trace. — `scenario_hitl_resume.py`
- [x] **Layer 2** — Play Mode adversary emulation: every offensive step human-gated + checkpoint/resume, live-validated. — `simulation.py` / `scenario_play_mode.py`
- [x] **Layer 3** — tool/skill registry (dual-gate governance) + a PreToolUse sandbox hook, with tests. — `registry.py` / `sandbox_hooks.py`
- [x] **Gateway wiring + named-supervisor scenario** — `gateway.py` (create/target/teardown helpers, live-validated create→READY→delete on the GA API) + `scenario_named_supervisor.py` (loads `research-supervisor` from `harness.yaml`, wires it to a Gateway). — `gateway.py`
- [x] **Agent Factory** — config-driven fleet provisioning with dry-run validation, idempotency, and a cross-env tag-guard. — `factory.py`
- [x] **Gateway/Registry/Memory CDK stack** — synth-validated TypeScript CDK (Gateway/Memory CFN types are registered; the Registry CFN type is not yet GA, so that stack is synth-only for now). — `iac-cdk/`
- [x] **LiteLLM A2A specialist** — import-safe Strands+A2A+LiteLLM Runtime container skeleton with a tested agent-card (deps/Docker not built here). — `specialists/cve-intel/`
- [x] **BAS long-running tier** — async-gen entrypoint, HITL-gated offensive steps (reusing Play Mode), checkpoint + self-restart skeleton, tested. — `longrunning/bas-runner/`
- [ ] Deploy the CDK stack end-to-end once the Registry CFN type is GA; build & push the specialist container; run a live 3-specialist parallel A2A scan.
