attack-mapper · A2A specialist Runtime (reference skeleton + real reasoning)
============================================================================
A narrow **specialist** agent that a supervisor harness delegates to over A2A
(agent-to-agent). It mirrors ``specialists/cve-intel`` exactly for the serving
skeleton (guarded strands/a2a imports, an ``agent_card()``, ``build_agent()`` /
``build_app()`` / ``serve()``), and adds the piece that makes this specialist
*useful*: a REAL, deterministic, LLM-free attack-path reasoner
(:func:`build_attack_paths`) that turns an exposure surface (from the
``asset_lookup`` tool) into ranked high-risk attack chains.

What is real vs. skeleton vs. simulated
---------------------------------------
- **REAL** — :func:`build_attack_paths` is pure-python graph reasoning: it finds
  entry nodes (internet-exposed AND carrying a known-vulnerable service),
  traverses trust edges, and ranks the resulting chains by exploitability and
  impact. Same surface in, same ranked chains out. No LLM, no network, no tokens.
  It is fully unit-testable offline.
- **SKELETON** — the A2A serving wrapper (``build_agent`` / ``build_app`` /
  ``serve``) is the guarded skeleton: heavy deps imported lazily so the module
  (and its agent-card, and the reasoner) is importable and testable without the
  specialist stack installed.
- **SIMULATED / NON-OFFENSIVE** — this specialist only *reasons about* attack
  paths from asset metadata. It performs NO exploitation, NO scanning, NO live
  network activity. Any downstream validation of a chain stays HITL-gated behind
  the existing Play Mode (``sentinel_harness/simulation.py``); detonation of a
  sample is a separate SIMULATED one-shot-microVM skeleton. Nothing here touches
  a real target.

Why LiteLLM here (and not on the supervisor)
--------------------------------------------
The supervisor is a config-only Bedrock **Harness** (Bedrock-model-only). A
specialist runs in its *own* Runtime microVM, so it can use ``LiteLLMModel`` to
reach a cheaper/narrower model. See BLUEPRINT §0 "Harness is Bedrock-model-only".

Why the imports are guarded
---------------------------
``strands`` / ``strands-agents[a2a,litellm]`` / ``bedrock-agentcore`` are heavy,
platform-specific runtime deps that are NOT needed to *inspect* or test the
skeleton (agent-card shape, capability metadata, the ``build_agent`` factory
contract) or to run the deterministic reasoner. They are imported lazily inside
the factory so this module is always importable — CI stays green without the
specialist stack installed. The real deps are only touched when you actually
``build_agent()`` / ``serve()`` inside the container.

Configuration (12-factor — no hardcoded account / ARN / model)

You are the attack-mapper specialist. You answer exactly one kind of question: \
given an environment (asset/subnet), return the ranked high-risk attack paths.

Rules:
- Use your tools: call asset_lookup to fetch the exposure surface (hosts, \
  exposed services, known-vuln flags, trust edges); use attack_lookup to attach \
  the relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique to each hop.
- The ranking of chains is computed by the deterministic reasoner over the \
  surface — do NOT invent, reorder, or re-score chains by intuition. Report the \
  chains it returns, in the order it returns them.
- NEVER claim a host is exploited, a chain is validated, or an exploit exists. \
  You reason over metadata only. Any real validation is HITL-gated elsewhere.
- Do not answer questions outside attack-path reasoning; a supervisor routes \
  those elsewhere.

Return a single JSON object:
{"query": str, "chains": [{"entry": str, "path": [str], "techniques": [str], \
  "score": number, "impact": str, "rationale": str}], "grounded": bool}

    This is the REAL reasoning core — pure, deterministic graph traversal with

    Algorithm
    ---------
    1. Index the surface into host + outgoing-edge maps.
    2. Find ENTRY nodes: internet-exposed hosts that carry a ``known_vuln``
       service (initial access via T1190). No entries -> return ``[]`` (a
       fully-patched / non-exposed surface has no attack path).
    3. From each entry, DFS along trust edges (cycle-safe via a visited set,
       bounded by ``max_depth``), emitting a chain at EVERY reachable node
       (the entry itself is a length-1 chain, each pivot extends it). Emitting
       intermediate chains — not just leaves — means a high-value host reached
       mid-path is still surfaced even if the path continues past it.
    4. Score each chain by exploitability × impact (see :func:`_score_chain`).
    5. Rank descending by score; ties broken deterministically by (shorter
       path first, then entry id, then path) so output ordering is stable.

    the per-edge technique for each pivot — a caller can enrich these via the
    ``attack_lookup`` tool. ``entry_cve`` surfaces the CVE that made the entry
    node vulnerable (grounding the "why is this the way in" claim).
