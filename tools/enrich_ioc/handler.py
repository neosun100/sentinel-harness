"""enrich_ioc — IOC reputation / enrichment tool (mock-world reference stub).

.. warning::
   **This is CLEARLY-LABELED MOCK DATA for POC / testing only.** It is *not*
   real threat intelligence and *not* a real reputation feed. Every indicator
   it scores is drawn from ``mockdata.world`` — fictional but well-formed
   values (RFC 5737 documentation IPs, ``example.test`` / ``example.com``
   domains, fabricated-but-valid-length SHA-256 hashes). Do NOT treat any
   verdict here as a real-world judgement about a real IP/domain/file.

SecOps purpose
--------------
Alert triage starts with indicators of compromise (IOCs): a src_ip on an alert,
a domain a host beaconed to, a file hash EDR flagged. Before an analyst (or an
agent) can decide "act or dismiss", each indicator needs a *reputation* — is it
known-bad, how confident, what category, and crucially *what else in the estate
it relates to*. Given one indicator or a batch, this tool returns that
normalized reputation view, reading the SAME fictional world every other
data-plane tool reads (``mockdata.world``) so enrichment cross-links cleanly to
the SIEM alert and the asset surface.

The headline cross-link (the "Log4Shell story")
------------------------------------------------
The C2 IP ``203.0.113.66`` tied to the Log4Shell alert (``alert-1001``) MUST
resolve to a **malicious** verdict with ``related_hosts`` including ``web-01`` —
that is the spine that lets triage pivot indicator → asset. This is asserted by
the offline test and by ``tests/test_mockworld.py``.

What is real vs. stubbed
------------------------
- The OFFLINE reputation is REAL, deterministic data: the same indicator always
  yields the same type/category/confidence/verdict/related_hosts. It is
  *synthetic* (from ``mockdata.world``), but nothing is fabricated at call time.
  An indicator NOT in the mock set returns ``known: false`` / ``verdict:
  "unknown"`` — never a crash, never a fabricated score.
- The LIVE path is a real, dependency-free client: with ``ENRICH_IOC_LIVE=1``
  it POSTs the validated indicators as JSON to ``ENRICH_IOC_URL`` (with an
  optional ``Bearer`` token from ``ENRICH_IOC_TOKEN``) using only stdlib
  ``urllib.request`` — no third-party deps — then normalizes the JSON reply
  into the SAME output contract as the stub (``source="live"``). Any failure —
  missing URL, connection error, timeout, non-2xx status, or malformed JSON —
  is returned as ``{ok: False, error: "upstream_error", message}``. It NEVER
  silently falls back to the mock data, so opting into live and getting nothing
  back is never mistaken for "clean".

Egress & secrets posture
------------------------
- Egress is CONTROLLED. A live backend call happens only when
  ``ENRICH_IOC_LIVE=1`` AND the runtime network policy permits egress. In the
  default (offline) mode there is zero network I/O.
- Secrets are CONTROLLED. Any backend endpoint/token is read only from the
  environment (``ENRICH_IOC_URL`` / ``ENRICH_IOC_TOKEN``) — never hardcoded,
  logged, or echoed back in responses.
- Execution role / region are referenced via the standard harness environment
  variables ``SENTINEL_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN``, ``SENTINEL_REGION`` and
  ``AWS_PROFILE`` (never hardcoded account IDs or ARNs).

Input contract
--------------
event = {"indicator": "203.0.113.66"}              # a single indicator, or
event = {"indicators": ["203.0.113.66", "..."]}    # a batch (list of strings)

The indicator TYPE (ip / domain / sha256) is auto-detected by shape; the caller
does not have to declare it.

Output contract (on success)
----------------------------

    "ok": True,
    "source": "stub" | "live",
    "results": {
        "203.0.113.66": {
            "type": "ip",              # ip | domain | sha256

            "threat_category": "c2",   # c2 | scanner | phishing | malware | ...

        ...

}
