"""mockdata.accounts — a FICTIONAL multi-account cloud inventory for ops-automation.

.. warning::
   **CLEARLY-LABELED MOCK DATA for POC / testing only.** This is *not* a real
   AWS Organization, *not* a real account inventory, and describes *no* real
   company or environment. The 12-digit account ids below
   (``111111111111`` / ``222222222222`` / ``333333333333`` / ``444444444444``)
   are **obviously-fictional repeated-digit demo ids** — they are NOT real AWS
   account numbers. They are used only as opaque keys in this data file and are
   deliberately never placed in an ``arn:`` / ``iam::`` context anywhere.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The ops-automation capability ("MCP does multi-account ticketing / resource
queries") needs a coherent multi-account world to reason over: a supervisor
agent should be able to enumerate accounts, list the open operational findings
in each, and open a ticket for the real ones. Rather than let the ops tool
invent its own disconnected fixtures, it reads *this* inventory so every query
agrees on the same accounts, resource counts, and findings.

This inventory is intentionally SEPARATE from :mod:`mockdata.world` (the
alert-triage SecOps world). Multi-account cloud posture is a different plane
than per-host SIEM/asset data, so it gets its own self-contained loader; the
world's Log4Shell narrative is untouched.

Determinism
-----------
Everything here is literal Python data. There is no clock, no randomness, no
I/O. :func:`accounts` returns a fresh deep copy each call, so a caller mutating
the result can never corrupt the shared source. Same call in -> same data out.

Finding types
-------------
Each account carries zero or more open operational findings. The ``finding_type``
values are a small closed vocabulary the ops tool filters on:

- ``public_s3``            — an S3 bucket exposed to the public internet.
- ``over_permissive_role`` — an IAM role with a wildcard / admin-style policy.
- ``unencrypted_volume``   — an EBS volume without at-rest encryption.
- ``mfa_disabled``         — a privileged principal without MFA enforced.

API
---
- :func:`accounts` -> the full account inventory (fresh deep copy each call).
- :func:`finding_types` -> the sorted set of finding_type values present.

# Fictional multi-account inventory (synthetic, deterministic).
#
# Four accounts spanning prod + non-prod:
#   - prod-payments (111...): a public S3 bucket AND an over-permissive role;
#   - prod-web (222...): an unencrypted volume;
#   - dev-sandbox (333...): a low-severity mfa_disabled finding;
#   - security-audit (444...): CLEAN (no open findings) — a negative case so the
#     agent must not over-report. (Note: it is tagged environment=prod, so three
#     accounts are prod; `environment` is descriptive metadata, not a filter key.)
# The prod accounts give the triage supervisor real issues to open tickets for.
# Resource counts are small, round, and fictional.
#
# Account ids are OBVIOUSLY-FICTIONAL repeated-digit demo ids, NOT real AWS
# account numbers, and never appear in an arn:/iam:: context.
