"""
Scenario 3 — Detection-rule generation with adversarial review + publish gate
==============================================================================
Layer 1 (Strategy Iteration) · detection engineering.

Mirrors the customer flow "auto-generate detection rule -> multi-round agent
cross-review -> human merge". Demonstrates the generation != evaluation principle:
a *generator* harness writes a Sigma rule, a separate *adversarial-reviewer* harness
attacks it (false-positive sources, logic gaps), then a human-in-the-loop publish
gate requires analyst sign-off before the rule goes live.

Two independent harnesses (generator + reviewer) = the cheapest, most reliable way
to catch a generator's own blind spots. All generic; runnable on a dev account.
