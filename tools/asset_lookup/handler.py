"""asset_lookup — exposure / asset-surface lookup tool (reference template).

SecOps purpose
--------------
Attack-path reasoning (see ``specialists/attack-mapper``) needs a picture of
the environment it is reasoning over: which hosts exist, which services/ports
they expose, whether any exposed service carries a *known-vulnerable* flag, and
what *trust edges* connect one host to another (SSH key reuse, shared admin
credentials, flat network segments, service-account chains). Given an asset or
subnet query, this tool returns that **exposure surface** in a normalized,
deterministic structure the mapper's graph reasoning consumes directly.

This is a *reference implementation* for wiring into an Amazon Bedrock
AgentCore Gateway as an MCP target (Lambda-style handler). It runs entirely
OFFLINE by default from a small embedded, synthetic fixture environment; a live
backend (CMDB / asset-inventory / scanner API) is opted into later via
``ASSET_LOOKUP_LIVE=1``. That keeps the template testable in CI with no
network, no secrets, and no external dependencies.

What is real vs. stubbed
------------------------
- The OFFLINE surface is REAL, deterministic data: the same query always yields
  the same hosts/services/edges. It is *synthetic* (no real environment), but it
  is a faithful shape for the mapper to reason over — nothing is fabricated at
  call time.
- The LIVE path is a REAL stdlib HTTP client (``urllib.request``, no third-party
  dependencies). When ``ASSET_LOOKUP_LIVE=1`` it POSTs the validated query as
  JSON to ``ASSET_LOOKUP_URL`` (with an optional ``ASSET_LOOKUP_TOKEN`` bearer)
  and normalizes the JSON reply into the exact same surface shape as the stub,
  tagged ``source="live"``. On any failure (missing URL, timeout, non-2xx,
  malformed JSON, unreachable backend) it returns an explicit ``upstream_error``
  and NEVER silently falls back to fixtures — so an operator who *opts into*
  live and gets nothing learns why.

Egress & secrets posture
------------------------
- Egress is CONTROLLED. A live backend call happens only when
  ``ASSET_LOOKUP_LIVE=1`` AND the runtime network policy permits egress. In the
  default (offline) mode there is zero network I/O.
- Secrets are CONTROLLED. Any backend endpoint/token is read only from the
  environment (``ASSET_LOOKUP_URL`` / ``ASSET_LOOKUP_TOKEN``) — never hardcoded,
  logged, or echoed back in responses.
- Execution role / region are referenced via the standard harness environment
  variables ``SENTINEL_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN``, ``SENTINEL_REGION`` and
  ``AWS_PROFILE`` (never hardcoded account IDs or ARNs).

Input contract
--------------
event = {"query": "10.0.0.0/24"}   # a subnet in CIDR form, or
event = {"query": "web-01"}        # a single asset/host id, or
event = {"query": "*"}             # the whole known surface
