sentinel-harness · connector conformance kit
=============================================
A reusable, importable contract checker that certifies ANY connector — the ones
shipped here AND a third party's own — against the sentinel connector contract.
This is what makes the connector framework genuinely extensible: write a
connector, run it through :func:`check_siem_connector` /
:func:`check_ticketing_connector`, and a green result means it will slot into the
tool's ``*_LIVE`` path correctly.

.. warning::
   **Pure, offline, deterministic — no network, no AWS.** The kit exercises a
   connector only through its two pure methods with synthetic native fixtures. It
   never opens a socket. A connector that passes here is contract-correct; whether
   its *live* endpoint works is a deployment concern the kit deliberately does not
   touch.

What "conformant" means
-----------------------
A SIEM connector is conformant iff:
  1. it exposes ``name`` (non-empty str), ``build_request(selector, value)``,
     ``parse_response(payload)``;
  2. ``build_request`` returns ``{"body": <json-able>, "path": <str>}`` for the
     wildcard query and for a field selector, and the body is JSON-serializable;
  3. ``parse_response`` of the connector's OWN sample native reply yields a list of
     dicts, each carrying EXACTLY the neutral 10-field event shape;
  4. ``parse_response`` of a malformed/foreign envelope raises ``ConnectorError``
     (never returns a bare list or swallows the error) — so a broken backend reply
     is never mistaken for "zero events".

A ticketing connector is conformant iff:
  1. it exposes ``name``, ``build_request(request)``, ``parse_response(payload)``;
  2. ``build_request`` of a neutral ticket returns ``{"body", "path"}`` (json-able);
  3. it rejects a title-less request with ``ConnectorError``;
  4. ``parse_response`` of its OWN sample reply yields ``{ticket_id, status, url}``
     with a non-empty ``ticket_id``; a malformed reply raises ``ConnectorError``.

Because different backends have different native envelopes, the kit asks the
connector to *provide its own* sample native reply via an optional
``sample_response()`` method; if absent, the shipped connectors are covered by the
built-in fixtures below (keyed by ``name``). A third-party connector should
implement ``sample_response()`` so the kit can certify it with no edits here.

Nothing here is customer- or company-specific.
