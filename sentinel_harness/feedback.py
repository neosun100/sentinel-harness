sentinel-harness · M6 feedback engine (event-driven strategy self-iteration)
=============================================================================
Layer 3 (cyber-skills) · the FEEDBACK LOOP that closes the loop between
alert-triage *dispositions* and the *detection strategy* that produced them.

WHY this module exists
----------------------
M1/M2 gave the harness a self-improving detection loop; M5 gave it a mock world
and an end-to-end alert-triage POC that emits a disposition
(``true_positive`` / ``false_positive`` / ``benign``). M6 is the missing edge:
those dispositions must FEED BACK into the strategy so noisy rules get their
allowlist tightened and dead rules get regenerated — automatically, on the
event stream, not by a human eyeballing a dashboard.

This is the deterministic, offline heart of that loop:

1. :func:`record_disposition` folds a batch of :class:`FeedbackEvent`\\ s into a
   per-rule *ledger* (tp/fp counts + an ``fp_rate``). Conceptually this is the
   "write the analyst verdicts to Memory ``facts/{tenant}``" step — modeled
   deterministically here. A ``memory_writer`` callable can be injected to
   actually persist it (see :func:`managed_memory_writer` for the documented
   hook that WOULD call ``core.managed_memory`` under a per-``actorId``
   ``facts/{tenant}`` namespace). The default is a pure in-memory store, so the
   whole engine is offline-testable with ZERO AWS.
2. :func:`detect_triggers` turns that ledger into concrete improvement TASKS
   using explicit thresholds: a rule that is mostly false-positive over enough
   events emits a ``whitelist_optimization`` task; a rule that produced ONLY
   false positives (a dead/misfiring rule) emits a ``rule_regeneration`` task.

Honesty / what is real vs. stubbed
----------------------------------
- The feedback ENGINE, the fp_rate math, the trigger thresholds and the task
  generation are REAL deterministic offline logic (same input -> same output).
- The ``whitelist_optimization`` task is a real, directly-actionable artifact
  (it names the exact FP alert cohort to suppress).
- The ``rule_regeneration`` task is a *request* to the EXISTING M1/M2
  self-improving loop (harnesses/self-improving + tools/run_evaluation +
  scenarios/scenario_detection_gen). Running that loop is live-capable; here it
  is driven in-process/offline for the POC. This module does NOT itself call an
  LLM, stand up AWS, or claim to regenerate a rule live — it only emits the task.

Egress & secrets posture
-------------------------
- Egress is CONTROLLED: the default path has ZERO network / AWS / LLM I/O. It
  reads only its in-memory inputs. The AWS-backed persistence path is opt-in via
  an injected ``memory_writer`` (never the default).
- No secrets, no hardcoded account ids / ARNs. All identifiers are the
  clearly-fictional mock-world ids (RFC 5737 IPs, ``example.test`` hosts).

    """Emit a regeneration task when a PROMOTED harness's eval score decays.

    The disposition-driven :func:`detect_triggers` closes the loop on *alert
    noise*; this closes it on *eval-quality drift*. A harness is promoted to
    production at some baseline eval score (the M1/M2 ``score->revise->promote``
    loop, mirrored offline in ``scenario_self_improve_loop``). If a later
    re-score shows the score has decayed past a threshold — or fallen below an
    absolute floor — a whitelist patch is irrelevant: the *detection itself*
    must be regenerated. This function emits exactly that hand-off, using the
    SAME ``rule_regeneration`` task shape (``type`` + ``target``) the existing
    only-FP path emits, tagged with ``trigger="eval_score_decay"`` so a consumer
    can tell WHY the regeneration was requested.

    Score model
    -----------
    Eval scores follow the repo's convention: a float in ``[0, 1]`` with a
    ``pass_bar`` (default ``0.7``, matching ``scenario_self_improve_loop``).
    The baseline / latest score are resolved deterministically:

    - ``baseline``: the explicit promoted-at score if given; else ``scores[0]``
      (the oldest = the score the harness was promoted at).
    - ``latest``: the explicit latest score if given; else ``scores[-1]`` (the
      newest re-score).

    Provide EITHER a ``scores`` history (oldest -> newest) OR an explicit
    ``latest`` + ``baseline`` pair (or any mix — explicit values win).

    Trigger policy (deterministic)
    ------------------------------
    ``decay = baseline - latest`` (rounded to 10 dp to kill float drift). A task
    is emitted when EITHER:

    - ``decay >= decay_threshold`` — the score dropped by at least the allowed
      margin from its promoted baseline (inclusive boundary, mirroring
      ``fp_rate >= fp_threshold``); OR
    - ``min_score`` is set and ``latest < min_score`` — the score fell below an
      absolute quality floor regardless of how gentle the slope was.

    A stable / improved score (``decay`` below threshold and at/above any floor)
    emits ``None``. Pure function of its arguments: no clock, no randomness, no
    network, no AWS.

    Returns
    -------
    ``None`` when healthy, or a task dict mirroring the ``rule_regeneration``
    shape::
