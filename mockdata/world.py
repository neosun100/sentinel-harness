"""mockdata.world — the single-source-of-truth FICTIONAL SecOps enterprise.

.. warning::
   **This is CLEARLY-LABELED MOCK DATA for POC / testing only.** It is *not*
   real threat intelligence, *not* a real SIEM export, and describes *no* real
   company, person, host, or network. Every network artifact is drawn from the
   IANA documentation ranges reserved exactly for this purpose:

   - IPs: RFC 5737 documentation ranges ``192.0.2.0/24``, ``198.51.100.0/24``,
     ``203.0.113.0/24``.
   - Domains: ``example.test`` / ``example.com`` (RFC 6761 reserved names).
   - Hashes: syntactically valid SHA-256 (64 hex chars) but fabricated.
   - AWS account ids, if ever referenced, are the ``000000000000`` placeholder.

Why this module exists
----------------------
An alert-triage POC needs a *coherent* world to reason over: an analyst (or an
agent) should be able to take a raw SIEM alert, enrich its indicators, look up
the targeted asset, and open a ticket — and have every hop line up. Rather than
let each of the four data-plane tools (``siem_query``, ``asset_lookup``,
``enrich_ioc``, ``create_ticket``) invent its own disconnected fixtures, they
all read *this* world. That guarantees cross-tool consistency: the host an
alert names is the same host ``asset_lookup`` knows, the IP an alert carries is
the same indicator ``enrich_ioc`` scores.

The headline cross-link (the "Log4Shell story")
------------------------------------------------
One alert (``alert-1001``) is a Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) exploitation attempt
against ``web-01`` originating from a known-malicious command-and-control IP
(``203.0.113.66``). That single event chains cleanly across all four planes::

    SIEM alert  alert-1001  (rule "Log4Shell JNDI Exploit Attempt")
        │  src_ip = 203.0.113.66
        ▼
    IOC enrich  ioc-c2-01   (203.0.113.66, category "c2", confidence high)
        │  relates_to = web-01
        ▼
    Asset       web-01      (internet-exposed https, known_vuln CVE-2021-44228)
        │  (see tools/asset_lookup/handler.py — SAME host id + SAME CVE)
        ▼
    Ticket      created from the correlated finding (seed ids show the sequence)

Determinism
-----------
Everything here is literal Python data. There is no clock, no randomness, no
I/O. ``load_world()`` returns a fresh deep copy each call, so a caller mutating
the result can never corrupt the shared source. Same query in → same data out.

Consistency with the asset plane
---------------------------------
Hosts ``web-01`` / ``app-01`` / ``db-01`` / ``bastion-01`` reuse the exact ids
and the ``web-01`` → ``CVE-2021-44228`` fact from
``tools/asset_lookup/handler.py``. A few more hosts (``win-ws-07`` workstation,
``dc-01`` domain controller) are added here to give the triage narrative more
surface. The two modules are kept deliberately in sync; the offline test
``tests/test_mockworld.py`` asserts the Log4Shell/web-01/CVE invariant.

    data-plane tool. Handing out the live lists would let one caller's mutation
    leak into another's read and silently break determinism. A copy keeps the
    source pristine while callers stay free to transform their slice.

    The returned dict is stable and self-consistent: every alert ``host``
    names a real host id, every malicious alert ``src_ip`` is present in the
    IOC set, and the Log4Shell alert (``alert-1001``) links the C2 IOC to
    ``web-01`` (which carries ``CVE-2021-44228``).
