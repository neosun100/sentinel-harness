sentinel-harness · PreToolUse sandbox security hooks (Layer-3 foundation)
=========================================================================
Pure-Python, deterministic validators that gate what a shell-capable agent tool
(e.g. ``InvokeAgentRuntimeCommand`` in a caller's own wrapper) is allowed to run.
They mirror the sandbox-isolation design: an *allowlist* of safe command verbs,
a *denylist* of destructive/exfiltration patterns, and *path confinement* to a
workspace root (no ``..`` traversal, no absolute paths outside the sandbox).

These functions make ZERO AWS calls, use no LLM, and are fully deterministic —
the same command string always yields the same verdict. Wire them as a
PreToolUse check: call ``validate_command(cmd)`` before executing, and refuse the
tool call when ``allowed`` is False, surfacing ``reason`` back to the agent.
